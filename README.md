# Overview
Source code in [`main.cpp`](./main.cpp) provides a functions used to communicate
with 
a [CCS811 air quality sensor sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3566).

See the `main()` method in this file for an example usage.

The Mbed platform is required. Although only for I2C serial communication, the
source code could easily be adapted to use any other platform which provides
an I2C API.
